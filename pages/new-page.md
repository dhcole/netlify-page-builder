    tagline: A tagline highlights your approach
    content: >-
      The tagline should inspire confidence and interest, focusing on the value
      that your overall approach offers to your audience. Use a heading typeface
      and keep your tagline to just a few words, and don’t confuse or mystify.


      Use the right side of the grid to explain the tagline a bit more. What are your goals? How do you do your work? Write in the present tense, and stay brief here. People who are interested can find details on internal pages.

      If you're thinking about setting up an auto body repair business, start here for a checklist of items to consider and permits that you may need to obtain to get your business off the ground. Please note that this guide does not substitute for legal or professional advice, and additional permits may be required depending on the circumstances of your business.

      The New Jersey Auto-Body Repair Facility Act, N.J.S.A. 39:13-1 et seq., requires that no person may operate an auto-body repair facility unless it is so licensed by the Motor Vehicle Commission.


      * To get an auto-body repair license visit the Motor Vehicle Commission site at <https://www.state.nj.us/mvcbiz/BusinessServices/AutoBodyRepair.htm>

      * The commission will issue licenses based on the work to be performed including full service, auto body limited and auto body new dealer sublet. A [heavy duty vehicle endorsement](https://www.state.nj.us/mvcbiz/BusinessServices/AutoBodyLicense.htm) is required for all licensed auto body repair facilities repairing vehicles weighing 14,000 pounds (GVWR) or more.  

      * To receive a license, you must be age 18 or older, have the legal capacity to contract and be liable for all debt incurred, exhibit character and responsibility, and have no criminal record.

      * Each application must also be accompanied by proof of a certificate of occupancy, along with written approval by the municipal clerk or zoning officer confirming that the location, establishment and maintenance was approved.

      * A certificate of occupancy is issued by the Municipal Building/Construction Department after the property owner has met all obligations under a Construction Permit, including required inspections according the Uniform Construction Code.

      * To obtain written approval, read your local zoning ordinance, which can be obtained from your local Municipal Clerk, and contact your Municipal Zoning Office.

      * If there are multiple locations for an auto body repair facility, you will need to submit separate applications for each place of business.

      * Facilities that have painting booths must also obtain an air quality permit. Visit this link to learn more: <https://www.state.nj.us/dep/aqpp/>
